= Project: Seppuku

= Description: 

Seppuku is a cmdline utility that simplifies killing procs listed in your ps table.
You simply specify the kill level and program name you want to kill - Seppuku will
prompt you to either kill *all* matches in the ps table, or, prompt you for each process
entry found.

= Usage

seppku -h 
Usage: seppuku [options] 
    -n, --name NAME                  Process name within ps table 
    -l, --level LEVEL                Kill level for operation 
    -h, --help                       Show this screen 

= Example

seppuku -l 9 - n deathrow_program


= Installation

Gem is hosted on gemcutter.org

= Notes:
the ps scan regexp might not work with *all* system ps utilities; if you experience any problems try to change
the ps related constants within the main lib file.
